# m_project: Culinary Mushroom incubator
Mushrooms are delicious and there are so many more varieties than the button mushrooms everyone turns to. After COVID hit and we were isolated and without the need to devote so much time to commuting, I decided that this was a great time to take up fungiculture. I will admit that Star Trek Discovery did "inoculate" the idea, but I have been interested in fungi since medical school when we learned their life cycle. I am still surprised that they breath O2, just like humans. 

This project is meant to allow me to be away from my mushrooms for longer periods of time, because I can see both how they are doing and off load some of the more tedious tasks to my Raspberry Pi Zero. I have setup a basic automation system to maintain their fruiting environment. Other parts of their life cycle are less labor intensive.
